# Film Review Sentiment Analysis
Various machine learning and data science tools are used to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews from the [Rotten Tomatoes dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sentiment-analysis-on-movie-reviews) found on Kaggle. The analysis is presented in a series of iPython Notebooks, with a final overarching analysis that summarizes the various techniques used in "overall\_story.ipynb".

In order to run the iPython Notebooks, Python 2.7 and iPython Notebooks must be installed. You must also have the Python 2.x version of each of these packages (all of these packages can be installed with pip):
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* NLTK (with various downloaded corpora - download as necessary)
* pattern
* numpy
